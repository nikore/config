# config

My personal terminal and dot file configuration for Linux (Arch) and MacOS

## Install
Start by cloning the repo
```
mkdir ~/projects
cd ~/projects
git clone https://github.com/nikore/config.git
cd config
```

### Linux (Arch)
The `setup.sh` script only works on ArchLinux currently and other variants of Arch. From your clone simply run:

```
./setup.sh
```

### MacOS
The `setup_macos.sh` script only works on recent copies of macos, generally this one only gets up date/fixes when I switch jobs. To use it run:

```
./setup_macos.sh
```
